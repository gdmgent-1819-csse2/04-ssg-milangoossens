    <h2>Opdracht 04: Static Site Generator</h2>
    <p>For this class we had to make a documentation website for previous projects using markdown files and a static site generator.
    I chose Gatsby for this project because i had heard of it and was eager to give it a try. 
    Our previous projects were about WebGl, a product of Khronos group and based on OpenGl.</p>
